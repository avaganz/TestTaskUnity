Test task

Create a game in Unity for Android and iOS. Player controls a character (Capsule) positioned on a limited field. The player's task is to avoid enemies (Cube) that try to catch up with the character and player should dodge mines (Sphere). Enemies are added to the field at certain intervals in random locations. After a collision, an explosion occurs and a window appears showing the time the player survived and an option to restart. The overall gameplay, architecture, and execution will be rated.

Try not to use third-party frameworks. If the use of frameworks is necessary, it should be explained. It should be possible to adjust the speeds and timings of Unity version 2021, the latest LTS. The final project should be uploaded to GitHub or a similar platform, with a ready-built for Android.
